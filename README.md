# NavaUsersList

Nice to meet you :) 
This is my Angular App, Nava Users List. 
In the app, you can view a list of users hosted in the Dummy API (https://dummyapi.io/), wich I used to manipulate the users via API rest.
In the project you can add a new user, edit, view your details (more data) and delete it from the list. 
I had a lot of fun doing the project and I'm very excited to improve it later! Below, I show you what was used in the app:

> Angular with TypeScript
> Angular Routes
> RXJS, Pipes and native tools of forms and validators
> Angular Material UI
> ES6 (async functions, array operators etc)

## Requirements

You can test the working app in the link below (in your desktop or phone):
https://infobrunus.github.io/nava-users-list/

To run the project, you will need to install the following tools:

> Node JS: Access https://nodejs.org/en/ to install the last version of Node JS. 

> Angular CLI: To manage the Angular projects, you will need to install the Angular Cli. Open your Terminal and run the command "npm install -g @angular/cli"

## Installing / Getting started

To run my project, you can open the terminal, go to the current folder ('/tnn-form') and run the command below to install the project dependencies:
`npm i`

When it's finished, you can run the command below to generate a local instance in your computer:
`ng serve`

## Exploring the Form

Now, you can navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you will see the initial page. 
The page shows a default task, so you can edit or delete it to create your own tasks.

## Testing

To test, you can run:
`ng test`

The tests are in their initial phase, but I had a lot of fun knowing and writing the tests :)
