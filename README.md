# NavaUsersList

Nice to meet you :)   
This is my Angular App, Nava Users List.  
In the app, you can view a list of users hosted in the Dummy API (https://dummyapi.io/), wich I used to manipulate the users via API rest.  
In the project you can add a new user, edit, view your details (more data) and delete it from the list.  
I had a lot of fun doing the project and I'm very excited to improve it later! Below, I show you what was used in the app:  

- Angular with TypeScript
- Angular Routes
- RXJS, Pipes and native tools of forms and validators
- Angular Material UI
- ES6 (async functions, array operators etc)

## Requirements

You can test the working app in the link below:
https://infobrunus.github.io/nava-users-list

To run the project, you will need to install the following tools:

- Node JS: Access https://nodejs.org/en/ to install the last version of Node JS. 

- Angular CLI: To manage the Angular projects, you will need to install the Angular Cli. Open your Terminal and run the command "npm install -g @angular/cli"

## Installing / Getting started

To run the project, you can open the terminal, go to the current folder ('/nava-users-list') and run the command below to install the project dependencies:
```npm i```

When it's finished, you can run the command below to generate a local instance in your computer:
```ng serve```

## Exploring the Form

Now, you can navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you will see the initial page. 
The page shows a list of registered users, so you can view their details, edit the information, delete it or even create new users!
